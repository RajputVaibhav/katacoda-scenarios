You can use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) direct APIs to directly read the data on your EBS snapshots, and identify the difference between two snapshots. You can view the details of blocks in an EBS snapshot, compare the block difference between two snapshots, and directly access the data in a snapshot.
