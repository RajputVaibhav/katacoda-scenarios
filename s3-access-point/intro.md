Amazon S3 Access Points simplify managing data access at scale for shared datasets in S3. Access points are named network endpoints that are attached to buckets that you can use to perform S3 object operations, such as `GetObject` and `PutObject`. Each access point has distinct permissions and network controls that S3 applies for any request that is made through that access point.
